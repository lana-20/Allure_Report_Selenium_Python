One on the common __challenges__, when automating with __Selenium__, is that I __need to depend on third party tools for any reporting related capabilities__. No reporting tools or interface provided by Selenium, no such reporting API. But QTP, RFT, TestComplete provide their own reporting tool/section/module with great pass/fail result reports. In Selenium, I need to integrate third party tools, like TestNG, ExtentReport or __Allure Plugin__.
